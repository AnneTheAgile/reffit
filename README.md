reffit
======

Reffit is a community micro-review system for science papers.  It takes ideas from [StackOverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com) and [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com) (reputation, stream of posts, tags, comment sorting by voting, followers, anyone can register to write, read even without registration), and tries to focus on building a single-page overview of a paper's good and bad points, from an insider's perspective but in language that anyone could understand enough to evaluate.
