  <h2>What is Reffit?</h2>
  <p><strong>Reffit</strong> is an online community of science enthusiasts and scientists trying to improve the way research is evaluated and shared.  Joining us on Reffit means shaping the public conversation around research you care about.  The fruit of your labor will be </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Accessible summaries of original research</li>
    <li>Collaborative <em>evaluation</em> of scientific findings - a way to quickly understand which findings are real, and what is just spin</li>
    <li>Connection with scientists (if you're not one)</li>
    <li>Connections with normal people (if you're a scientist)</li>
    <li>A database of scores that can be mined for interesting data about how science is evolving (like <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com">OkTrends</a>)</li>
    <li>Data to help granting agencies and universities evaluate candidates</li>
    <li>Encouragement for scientists to come out from the ivory tower</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What does that mean, concretely?</h2>

  <p>The idea is to collect a large number of individual bits of praise and criticism for scientific works.  Readers click on the summaries they find helpful, and the praise and criticism they agree with.  We collect and sort that invormation to build a quick overview of what a paper means, what's good about it, and how trustworthy it is.  Noone can be an expert in every field, so these overviews can give you a more informed perspective on a paper that before you could only appreciate from a distance.</p>

 <h2>Isn't that system sensitive to vote-rigging?</h2>

 <p>Yes!  The system is not fireproof.  Papers and comments will receive scores that influence their visibility on the site.  But the goal isn't to generate a <em>score</em> for a paper, but to generate <em>overviews</em>.  A big part of the rationale for keeping the site open to all users (not just scientists) is to balance out the effect of individuals trying to promote one piece of work at the expense of others.  If vote-rigging seems to be happening on a paper you're interested in, please let us know and we will see if we can find out who's involved.</p>

  <h2>I'm a scientist, what does Reffit offer me?</h2>
  <p>A chance to join the water-cooler conversation about your papers and your peers' papers, in the open. And a chance to learn about the details of common problems with statistics and interpretation that detract from a paper's quality.  Like PubPeer and Publons, Reffit wants to fill the strange vacuum left when referees' comments aren't published along with a paper, and the press release doesn't really give a fair critique.</p>

  <h2>I pay taxes that fund research, should I be interested in Reffit?</h2>
  <p>Oh gosh, yes.  You want science to find cures, make new technology, and discover how the world works.  But academic science is in a bit of a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/28/us-science-cancer-idUSBRE82R12P20120328">crisis</a> right now, with many high-profile papers' conclusions failing to hold up under replication.  A lot of time and money get wasted because the results of failed experiments aren't shared between labs.  We think part of the problem is cultural, having to do with the way scientists are rewarded for the flashiness of their headlines instead of their rigor and reproducibility.  This isn't necessarily scientists' fault - they often face real, tangible pressure to over-sell their work, and there aren't many rewards in place for sharing the results of an experiment that didn't have an exciting outcome.  Lots of projects are springing up to try to attack this problem from various angles, like PLoS, eLife, PubPeer, Faculty of 1000, Frontiers, Publons, and Reffit.  Reffit is an experiment in collaborative evaluation and community engagement - we <em>hope</em> that it could help to shape the culture and improve collaboration.</p>

    <h2>My labmate's paper is flawed, but I'm afraid to publicly call out the error.</h2>

  <p>Sign in to your Reffit account and post invididual comments anonymously (we require <em>some</em> kind of logging in just to make sure a single person doesn't double-vote, but we won't let anyone see you as the source of the comment or vote).  Sometimes you want to be seen; sometimes you want to be anonymous, so we encourage you to choose on a case-by-case basis.  If you are free to do so, associating your activity with your username allows us to track the popularity of that activity and give you a score.  That's part of the fun of Reffit and part of the open, honest atmosphere we want to provide.  If you need a platform to blow a whistle anonymously, we are glad that this can be your platform, too.  Do remember that accusations of misconduct are an extremely serious thing, and unless you have hard evidence of actual fraud, it is probably best to raise your issue as a run-of-the-mill 'criticism'.</p>
