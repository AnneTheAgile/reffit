  <h2>What is Reffit?</h2>
  <p><strong>Reffit</strong> is an online community of science enthusiasts and scientists trying to improve the way research is evaluated and shared.  Joining us on Reffit means shaping the public conversation around published research you care about.  The fruit of your labor will be </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Accessible summaries of original research</li>
    <li>Collaborative <em>evaluation</em> of scientific findings - a way to quickly understand which findings are real, and what is just spin</li>
    <li>Meaningful interaction between scientists and non-scientists</li>
    <li>A database of scores that can be mined to see how science is evolving</li>
    <li>A portal for discovering interesting and provocative new science science</li>
    <li>Blurring of the distinctions between published research, research in progress, science reporting, and data-sharing</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How does Reffit do that?</h2>

  <p>On the macro-level, you get to follow scientists, yoru friends, and research topics.  On the micro-level, we collect small units of reactions to research papers - a brief summary, a single piece of praise for one aspect of the work, a single criticism of one aspect of the analysis or interpretation.  Through votes the community builds of a synopsis of the paper that goes beyond press accounts - it actually helps you judge how reasonable that research team's promises for the future are, even if you're not an expert in the field.</p>

  <h2>I'm a scientist, what does Reffit give me?</h2>
  <p>A chance to join the water-cooler conversation about your papers and your peers' papers, in the open. And a chance to learn about the details of common problems with statistics and interpretation that detract from a paper's quality.</p>

  <h2>I pay taxes that fund research, why should I be interested in Reffit?</h2>
  <p>There are shocking inefficiencies with the way science is evaluated right now.  You may or may not know that, as a tax payer, you can't currently read most of new research papers because of the way publishing is set up.  Funding agencies distribute your money to labs and departments based on the decisions of scientists and administrators who can't possibly be an expert in every paper they evaluate.  The peer-review system we have in place for choosing which papers can be published is fraught with politics; a scientist has her paper judged by anonymous reviewers that are also fierce competitors.  These problems force scientists to limit the scope of their work, and to minimize discussions about research until the research is in print.</p>
  <p>A lot of people are working to improve the efficiency in science so that we can see more cures and more technology.  Reffit, PLoS, eLife, PubPeer, Faculty of 1000, Publons, and Frontiers are all projects trying to fix these problems.</p>

  <h2>I'm on a faculty search committee.</h2>
  <p>You and the other committee members are probably excellent at judging papers in your own fields, but it can be hard to tell - did your candidate from a slightly different field use a concentration of ethanol known to make worms rotate?  Is that just another complicated formula with an important-sounding title, or do computational biologists agree that it's great insight with implications for false-hit rates in gene screens?  The Reffit community's aim is to digest these issues and give you the specialist's ability to see that candadite's papers' strengths and weaknesses - quickly.

    <h2>My labmate's paper is flawed, but I'm afraid to publicly call out the error.</h2>
