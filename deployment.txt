Reffit is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance.  Updating reffit requires a private key.

Get the new code

 * ```ssh -i path/to/key ubuntu@reffit.com```
 * If possible (not possible yet) put a
   "down for maintenance in a few minutes" note up on the site
 * git pull
 * cabal install (during installation, reffit.com will be 
   very sluggish.  Building takes ~ 10 minutes)
 * In stagingReffit
 * git pull
 * cabal install

Check that the new code can run

 * Frow a browser on any machine: http://reffit.com/checkpoint
 * Quickly copy state/ and users.json from ~/reffit to stagingReffit
   (may have to briefly stop reffit.com to do this)
 * Start the stagingReffit server to make sure that the new reffit
   code can load the old data.  Use a port other than 8000.

Start up the new server

 * ```ps aux | grep reffit``` make sure there's only one
 * ```pidof reffit``` and remember this number
 * From a browser on any machine: http://reffit.com/state_to_disk  
   This is kind of a backup - it runs the current PersistentState
   through Data.Serial.put and saves it on the disk on the EC2
   instance.
 * From a browser on any machine: http://reffit.com/checkpoint
   This (as far as I understand) takes all queued Acid-State
   transactions in the log and applies them.
 * Immediately after state_to_disk and checkpoint, kill the server
   ```sudo kill -9 theReffidPID
 * Now restart the server
   ```sudo nohup .cabal-sandbox/bin/reffit -p 80 &```
 * Go to reffit.com, pray :)
